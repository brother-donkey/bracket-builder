# Remainders to do things

- add post css
- exp with post html
- ensure autoprefixing
- sort out input of zero in scores
- handle redeclaration of match result
- keep track of focus in .game elements so that we can return to the place after the finish game modal closes
- add random mode (randomize seeds)
- finish bye games automatically
- bug: you've got it so that uniq names can mess it up when games are declared finished
